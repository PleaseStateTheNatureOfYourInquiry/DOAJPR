Governance
==========

The journal is governed by two main bodies: the steering committee and the editorial board. The steering committee is responsible for overseeing all non-editorial functions of the journal, whereas the editorial board oversees the peer review process.

Steering committee roles
------------------------

The steering committee is in charge of overseeing all non-editorial functions of the journal, enforcing the journal's non-editorial policies, creating subcommittees when needed, and facilitating the flow of information among the editorial board and subcommittees. The steering committee is composed of five members elected by the community, the editor-in-chief, and the heads of any subcommittees. After each election, the steering committee will designate a Chair who is responsible for setting the committee's agenda, organizing timely meetings, and holding an annual general assembly that is open to the public. The Chair has the right to appoint one additional steering committee member, if desired.

The steering committee appoints the editor-in-chief, which will be done in consultation with an editor search committee that is composed of journal members. The editor search committee will announce the open position to the community and will encourage suitable candidates to apply. Once selected, the editor-in-chief and the editor search committee will be responsible for nominating additional editors for the editorial board, who will then be presented to the steering committee for approval. All positions on the editorial board are for a term of five years.

The steering committee has the authority to create subcommittees when they are necessary. A public announcement will first be made seeking candidates for the subcommittee as well as candidates to lead the subcommittee. Once the subcommittee head is selected, they will be responsible for nominating additional subcommittee members who will be presented to the steering committee for approval. All subcommittee positions are for a term of five years.

All members of the journal are invited to attend the steering committee meetings. Non-steering committee members, however, will have no voting rights, and may be asked to leave when considering confidential matters.

Elections
---------

When one or more steering committee positions are open, the steering committee will organize an election. Anyone who has an account on the journal website may nominate themself for an open position, and anyone with an account on the journal website may vote. All elected positions are for a term of five years.
